{"text": "Tokyo Originally known as Edo (meaning “estuary”), Tokyo was just a sleepy little village surrounded by marshland on the broad Kanto plain until the end of the 16th century, when Tokugawa Ieyasu moved here and made it the center of his vast domains. When Ieyasu became shogun in 1603, Edo in turn became the seat of national government — and its castle the largest in the world. Edo expanded rapidly to accommodate Ieyasu’s 80,000 retainers and their families and the myriad common people who served their daily needs. By 1787 the population had grown to 1,368,000. The ruling elite lived on the high ground, the Yamanote (“bluffs”) west and south of the castle. The artisans, tradespeople, and providers of entertainment (reputable and not so reputable) lived “downtown” on the reclaimed marshlands north and east, in the area still known as Shitamachi. As these two populations interacted, a unique new culture was born. Edo became the center of power and also the center of all that was vibrant and compelling in the arts. After 1868 that center grew even stronger, when the movement known as the Meiji Restoration overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate and the imperial court moved to Edo. The city was renamed Tokyo (“Eastern Capital”), and from that moment on all roads — political, cultural, and financial — led here. In the 20th century Tokyo has twice suffered almost total destruction. First, the earthquake of 1923 and subsequent fire razed nearly all vestiges of old Edo, killing some 140,000 people in the process. Rebuilt without any comprehensive urban plan, Tokyo remains a city of subcenters and neighborhoods, even villages, each with its own distinct personality. Unlike the great capital cities of Europe, there is no prevailing style of architecture here, no “monumental” core for a new building to harmonize or clash with. Even after the collapse of the economic bubble in 1992, construction projects are everywhere. Whole blocks of the city seem to disappear overnight, replaced in the blink of an eye by new office buildings, condominiums, cultural complexes, and shopping centers. Tokyo is a city of enormous creative and entrepreneurial energy, much of which goes into reinventing itself. If there’s a commodity in short supply here, it’s relaxation. Nobody “strolls” in Tokyo, and there are few places to sit down outdoors and watch the world go by. The idea of a long, leisurely lunch hour is utterly alien. People in Tokyo are in a hurry to get somewhere — even if they don’t always know precisely where they’re going.
