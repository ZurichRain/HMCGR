{"text": "Asakusa Asakusa is the heart of Shitamachi, the quarter best-beloved of that fractious, gossipy, prodigal population called the Edokko, who trace their “downtown” roots back at least three generations. Edokko are suckers for sentimentality and for ninjo: the web of small favors and kindnesses that bind them together. Sneeze in the middle of the night and your Edokko neighbor will demand the next morning that you take better care of yourself; stay home with a fever and she will be over by noon with a bowl of soup. An Edokko craftsman would rather lose a commission than take any guff from a customer who doesn’t know good work when he sees it. Edokko quarrel in a language all their own, an earthy local dialect as profane and expressive as Brooklynese. Ignore the proprieties — or offend the pride of an Edokko — and he will let you know about it, in no uncertain terms; respect his sense of values and you make a friend for life. The heart of Asakusa, in turn, is Sensoji (also known as the Asakusa Kannon temple). According to legend, the temple houses a small statue of the Buddhist goddess of mercy, found in the Sumida River by two local fishermen in the year 628 — but in fact not even the temple priests have ever seen it. When Edo became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate, Asakusa began to flourish as an entertainment quarter. In the early-19th century even the kabuki theaters were located here. The Meiji Restoration and the opening of Japan to exotic new Western-style amusements further enhanced Asakusa’s reputation as Fun City. The first place in Japan to call itself a “bar” opened in Asakusa in 1880 (and is still doing business); the first movie theater opened here in 1903. Before long, the streets and alleys around the temple were filled with music halls, burlesque theaters, cabarets, gambling dens, and watering holes of every description. Most of the temple quarter was firebombed to ashes in 1945, but by 1958 the people of the area had raised enough money to rebuild Sensoji and all of the important structures around it. So what if the restorations were in concrete? The original is still there in spirit — and no visitor should neglect it.
